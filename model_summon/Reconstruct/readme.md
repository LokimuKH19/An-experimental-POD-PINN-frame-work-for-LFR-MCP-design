# Result Discussion of POD-PINN with NN Interpolator

This is a detailed discussion of the enhanced program `../Reconstruct.py` (The new proposed method). It leverages pre-computed modal bases for the reconstruction of physical fields, and introduces a carefully balanced combination of **data loss** and **physics loss**.
# üìä Comparison of NN-based and KNN-based Interpolation in PINN

## üìù Summary
In our recent experiments with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) combined with proper orthogonal decomposition models (POD), we compared two approaches for interpolating spatial modal functions: classic K-nearest neighbors (KNN) vs. neural network (NN)-based interpolation. While KNN is generally more accurate in direct interpolation tasks, the NN-based interpolator surprisingly resulted in comparable in the full PINN training process, especially when considering speed and gradient support.

## üîç Key Observations

### üéØ 1. Interpolation Accuracy
- üü¢ **KNN** gives more accurate predictions at known points.
- üü° **NN** interpolator introduces more approximation error on the dataset but is smooth and 2nd-ordered differentiable.

### üîÅ 2. Gradient Flow
- ‚ùå KNN is non-2nd-differentiable, making it unsuitable for backpropagation through modal space. A shift must be done when computing the 2nd-ordered derivatives. 
- ‚úÖ NN interpolation supports end-to-end gradient flow, which greatly improves smoothness of the trail function in PINNs.

### ‚ö° 3. Training Efficiency
- üöÄ **NN-based interpolation** can run solely without datasets, leading to major speedups during training. Thus in the `../Reconstruct.py` I used more operating conditions (20) than `../ReconstructORI.py` (10) when computing physical losses. Also, the requirement of GPU memory became slighter.
- üê¢ KNN-based interpolation was computed with incorporating the whole `coordinates.csv`, which becomes a bottleneck in large-scale coordinate evaluations.

### üìâ 4. Loss Behavior
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Physics residual loss with NN interpolation tends to be higher (due to the interpolation with pure NN might encounter issues like overfitting or something, though I have tried)  
- üìà **Test loss actually goes down with Train Loss** in early training stage, indicating better generalization, as shown in the figure:

![POD-PINN with NN](./Losscurve_SEED42_LR0.005_HD30_HL2_Epoch113_WithPhysics1_WithBatch1.png)

‚ùóThe first 50 epochs are in the pre-training stage.

### ‚öñÔ∏è 5. Overall Trade-off

| üß© Aspect                     | üß≠ KNN                     | üöÄ NN Interpolation         |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| üéØ Accuracy                  | ‚úÖ Better (Train Loss 0.11, Test Loss 1.39)         | üî∏ Worse (the Least Test Loss 2.12 is given at the 35th epoch, with the Training Loss 0.84) |
| üîÅ Smoothness                | ‚Üì C1 on datapoints, C2 on others position                    | ‚Üë at least C2                       |
| ‚ö° Training Speed            | üê¢ Slow (Based on the Interpolators with Dataset)       | ‚ö° Significantly Faster  |
| üìâ Physics Residual          | ‚úÖ Lower (√ó1e-7~1e-6 to normalize)                   | üî∏ Higher (√ó1e-17~1e-15 to normalize)           |
| üß™ Generalization (comparing with Common NN whose test loss was 2.2)| ‚úÖ Better         | ‚úÖ Slightly Better   |

## ‚úÖ Practical Conclusion
Although NN-based interpolation might not be as precise as KNN in direct interpolation tasks, the advantages in training speed, differentiability, and overall performance in PINN training make it a much better choice for practical purposes. It smooths out the training dynamics and provides gradients where needed, helping the model converge faster and generalize better.

> In the future, if the interpolators based on NN are enhanced this method has potential to replace the KNN interpolator based POD-PINN.

> I have tried similar ideas before, using the NNs to upgrade methods from linear algebras into a functional based one, see in [DRQI](https://github.com/LokimuKH19/DRQI).

> Instead of viewing POD as a purely linear algebraic decomposition on discrete data, reformulating it as a variational optimization problem over function space might be a promising way. This naturally leads to a neural-network-based approach, where the basis functions are parameterized and trained directly to minimize projection error ‚Äî enabling more flexible, physically-informed, and generalizable continuous modal learning.

## üß† Combinining POD and Modal Interpolation with NN together?

In the previous version, we employed pure data-driven POD to extract main modals as eigenvectors. In specific, SVD is performed to snapshots matrix $X\in R^{m\times n}$ and the best **low-rank approximation** is obtained by combining the modals and the relative coefficients. However, these processes are still linear algebra tricks on **discrete matrix** and don't rely on the continuity of the practical physical system (or functional background), which therefore constraints its generalizability on physical modeling tasks.

üîÅ What my idea is, regarding the POD as a **functional optimization problem**, which means searching for a series of **orthogonal function basis** in the Hilbert space and achieving the smallest projection error with the input functions. Possibly written as the following form?

```math
 \max_{\phi\in H} \int_\Omega \left(\int_T u(x,t)\phi(x) dx \right)^2 dt\quad\quad \rm{s.t.} \|\phi\|_{L^2} = 1
```

In this formula, $x$ refers to the spatial coordinates, $t$ refers to different snapshots. And these snapshots come the CFD simulation results.

This formula is an functional optimization problem, we only have to translate it into a function peak/valley problem by introducing a neural network $\phi_\theta(x)$.

### üîß Key Idea

- Represent the **spatial mode function** $\phi_\theta(x)$ using a neural network.
- Define a loss function to find the mode that captures the most energy (should transfer to a minimize form and add a regularization term to improve smoothness of the loss function's landscape):
  
```math
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\int_T \left( \int_\Omega u(x, t)\phi_\theta(x)dx \right)^2 dt + \lambda\left(\|\phi_\theta\|_{L^2}^2 - 1\right)^2
```

- Replace the integrals with **Monte Carlo** approximations using sampled data points.
- Use **Adam** optimizer to train the network and get $\phi_\theta(x)$.

---

### üéØ What Do We Get?

We obtain:
- A **neural network approximation** of the most energetic mode $\phi_\theta(x)$.
- No need for matrix decomposition ‚Äî we‚Äôre solving a **functional extremum problem** directly.

---

### üìå How to Compute Modal Coefficients?

Once we obtain \(\phi_\theta(x)\), we project the solution field \(u(x,t)\) onto it to get the time-dependent coefficient:

```math
\alpha(t) = \int_\Omega u(x, t) \cdot \phi_\theta(x) \, dx
```

In code (discrete form):

```python
# coords: (M, D)
# u_vals: (M, T) -- each column is u(x) at time t
# phi_vals = phi_theta(coords)  # (M,)

alpha_t = torch.einsum('mt,m->t', u_vals, phi_vals) * dx
```

### üò∞ Wait... We only obtained the 1st Modal and its correspounding coefficient after such treatment...

Yes, your concern is correct. To train modals sequentially, orthogonality constraints should be added into the loss function. Suppose we have $\phi_1(x),\phi_2(x),...,\phi_{k-1}(x)$ now, to obtain $\phi_k(x;„ÄÅtheta)$, the following penalty term should be added to the loss function. Train your next model one by one. (And just watch how the error is accumulated desperately)

```math
\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( \int_\Omega \phi_j(x;\theta) \cdot \phi_i(x) \, dx \right)^2
```

Or you might train all $k$ modes simultaneously by letting the neural network output multiple functions. Then add constraints which describes "The components of the model are pairwise orthogonal", to the loss function.

‚ö†Ô∏è Obviously, This approach is more elegant but significantly harder to optimize. The models structures are too complex causing difficulties to training.

### üíÄ And what's more, the most fatal problem, the order

Unlike SVD, which naturally orders modes by descending eigenvalue (energy content), this functional optimization doesn‚Äôt inherently give you a way to control or sort the modes.

You must train **a particular modal function at a time**, and ensure it's orthogonal to all previously obtained ones ‚Äî which is nontrivial and not guaranteed in practice unless explicit constraints or projection steps are added.

May be you can add more regularization terms?
  - Gram-Schmidt orthogonality penalty
  - Energy-based sorting constraint (encouraging high-variance modes to appear earlier)
  - I once developed [Deep Rayleigh Quotient Iteration(DRQI)](https://github.com/LokimuKH19/DRQI) for **finding the 1st order eignevalue and its correspounding eigenfunction** of a differential operator with clear boundary conditions. Since POD fundamentally relies on extracting dominant modes via SVD‚Äîwhich is equivalent to solving an eigenvalue problem on the empirical covariance operator‚Äîwe might leverage the DRQI framework to do this in function space. If this can be applied, we could possibly obtained the modals with energy-based sorting... However, while DRQI has shown promise in solving operator eigenvalue problems ‚Äî and successfully passed benchmark tests such as the 1D neutron transport equation, 1~4D Laplace operator problem and Fokker-Plank operator problem ‚Äî it currently lacks validation on nonlinear PDEs.


### üß™ No Testing Yet

Due to the above compute cost and difficulty in managing multiple modes and ensuring orthogonality, **this idea has not yet been fully tested** in practice.

---

### üí° Summary

While this neural-functional approach to POD is elegant and insightful ‚Äî bridging the gap between linear algebra and function space ‚Äî it suffers from practical inefficiencies. Its scalability is currently limited, and managing mode quality and orthogonality remains an open challenge.

That said, it's an exciting conceptual direction that could inspire new work in physics-informed dimensionality reduction ‚Äî especially when paired with more powerful compute or smarter multi-mode training strategies.
